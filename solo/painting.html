				<h1>long time no see</h1>
				<p>One evening, lying on the grass I saw you first time in the sky. Maybe it was a hallucination. Now - these - days, I hardly see the evening. So, I can't see you in the sky. Perhaps it happens for busy urban life or serious effects of lead, metal, and other gases in the city sky. Or something else, a feeling named eagerness has been decreased for being out of sight. I believe I shall see you again in the clear sky, either in restful peace or in any other way.</p>

				<h1>Mother hood</h1>
				<p>I do not know where I was. I have known from medical science that, I have got my present situation for the competition of millions of DNA. I don't have any purpose to break the pure role of nature. But it is difficult to know which is right. If scientists invent a new theory that, a lifetime of human beings is reduced by drinking water, then people will try to stop drinking water. I can't understand where should I go, what should I receive or what should I reject, because of the lack of knowledge. I question myself, what to do? I do whatever I got from my soul. But now-these-days it is complicated to believe my soul. Recently knew that people are enriching their knowledge based on whatever they learn until the age of fifteen. Whenever I start a work based on previous experiences or preconceptions, it is changed or modified by different information and data while the work is going. In the end, I don't get the exact result that I thought before starting the work. This is the reality. So, I am saying to you my mom, whatever you thought about me before my birth yourself, it is so normal not to be like that. Trust me Ma, right now, this is the truth.</p>

				<h1>Wakeup story</h1>
				<p>I was going out towards uncertainty. Suddenly I stopped in front of a house in the darkness of night. I laid down on the floor of the mud house. I wake up hearing the chirping of birds. I saw the golden ray of sunlight making bath the ground of the veranda. The leaves and flowers decorated themselves with a 
					festive look. Breathing comfortably I saw a few bright white dressed people around me. Two of them came closer and said, today you goanna die. Please come back after taking bath in that pond. Then they took me into the same veranda after making me wear like them. They indicated I go to the very last door and lay down on the ground after closing the door. It was a very sweet smell to feel. Water sprayed on the ground just a few times back. It was a very peaceful and cool atmosphere. I was thinking in front of that door, is there any work rest to do? I realize whatever I wanted to do, I did already, and whatever is left has been started already. The smell of flowers was no more and birds stopped chirping when I entered that room and close the door. My body felt paralyzed. Suddenly I woke up and felt awesome. The dream of last night inspired me to walk again to infinity.
